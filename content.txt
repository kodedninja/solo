title: solo â€• the simplest publishing tool
----
text: This is *solo*. It's the simplest publishing tool that supports both the peer-to-peer and the normal web. It has a bigger brother, [orkl](https://orkl-kodedninja.hashbase.io), and an even bigger cousin, [Enoki](https://enoki.site).

The main inspiration was [Telegra.ph](http://telegra.ph). Every entry is under a different Dat URL and there's no index page like on blogs or publishing platforms. Only *disconnected texts* that centralize in the author's mind.

### Writing

Firstly, make an editable copy of an existing *solo* entry. 

Then, Navigate to the new site, delete what you don't need and you can start writing. In the content you can use [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and see the result by pressing the **preview** button. Naturally, if somebody else navigates to the site, they'll only see the result and can't edit the content.

You can add images too by dropping the file into the textarea.

You can share the entry by sharing the Dat URL.
