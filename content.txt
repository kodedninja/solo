title: solo â€• the simplest publishing tool
----
text: This is *solo*. It's the simplest publishing tool that supports both the peer-to-peer and the normal web. It has a bigger brother, [orkl](https://orkl-kodedninja.hashbase.io), and an even bigger cousin, [Enoki](https://enoki.site).

The main inspiration was [Telegra.ph](http://telegra.ph). Every entry is under a different Dat URL and there's no index page like on blogs or publishing platforms. Only *disconnected texts* that centralize in the author's mind.

### Writing

Firstly, make an editable copy of an existing *solo* entry. 

Then, Navigate to the new site and you can start writing. In the content you can use [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and see the result by pressing the **preview** button.

You can share the entry by sharing the Dat URL.
